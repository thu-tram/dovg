## Core Meaning

**thì** is used to **mark what the speaker is talking about first**, before saying something about it.
It helps organize the sentence by separating **the topic** (what is already known or assumed) from **the comment** (what the speaker wants to say about it).

**thì does not add new meaning by itself**. Its function is to guide the listener:
“About this thing/person/situation — here is my comment.”

Because of this, **thì** is extremely common in spoken Vietnamese.

## Situations / Uses

### S1: Highlighting the topic of the sentence

[1] – Còn tôi **thì** không đồng ý.
As for me, I don’t agree.

→ **tôi** is the topic.
**thì** signals that the speaker is now giving an opinion about it.

Without **thì**, the sentence is still grammatical, but less clear in contrast.

---

### S2: Contrasting two topics

[2] – Anh **thì** thích cà phê, còn tôi **thì** thích trà.
He likes coffee, while I like tea.

→ **thì** clearly separates and contrasts the two topics.
This use is very common in comparisons.

---

### S3: Returning to a known topic

[3] – Còn chuyện hôm qua **thì** để mai nói.
As for yesterday’s matter, let’s talk about it tomorrow.

→ The topic (chuyện hôm qua) is already known in the conversation.
**thì** helps bring it back into focus.

---

### S4: Giving an explanation or personal reaction

[4] – Trời mưa **thì** tôi ở nhà.
If it rains, I stay at home.

→ **thì** marks a natural or expected response to a situation.
The sentence sounds calm and conversational.

---

### S5: Softening statements in spoken Vietnamese

[5] – Biết **thì** biết, nhưng không chắc lắm.
I do know, but I’m not very sure.

→ **thì** makes the sentence sound less abrupt and more natural in speech.

---

## Contrast / Comparison (Cf)

**thì** vs **mà**

– **thì**: organizes information, sets up topic → comment
– **mà**: often adds contrast, explanation, or emotion

[6a] – Tôi **thì** không thích phim đó.
As for me, I don’t like that movie.

[6b] – Tôi không thích phim đó **mà**.
I don’t like that movie (with emphasis or attitude).

---

**thì** vs **là**

– **thì**: separates topic and comment
– **là**: links or identifies

[7a] – Còn anh **thì** sao?
And what about you?

[7b] – Anh **là** ai?
Who are you?

---

## Notes

• **thì** usually appears **after the topic**, not at the end of the sentence.

Correct:
✓ Tôi **thì** thích ở nhà.

Incorrect:
✗ Tôi thích ở nhà **thì**.

• **thì** is very often **optional**.
Removing it does not usually change the basic meaning, but it changes **how natural and organized the sentence sounds**.

Compare:
– Tôi không đi.
– Tôi **thì** không đi.

The second sounds more conversational and contrastive.

• **thì** is extremely common in spoken Vietnamese and informal writing.

• Do not translate **thì** directly into English.
Its function is structural and pragmatic, not lexical.
