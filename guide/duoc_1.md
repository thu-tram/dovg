## Notes

• **được** does NOT always indicate passive voice.
Like **bị**, it focuses on experience and result.

• **được** is rarely used for clearly negative situations.

Incorrect or unnatural:
✗ Tôi **được** mất tiền.

Correct:
✓ Tôi **bị** mất tiền.

• In spoken Vietnamese, **được** may be omitted when the meaning is clear, but keeping it adds emphasis to the positive result.
