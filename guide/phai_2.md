## Core Meaning

**phải₂** is used to show that the subject is **forced into a situation or action that is unwanted, unpleasant, or unavoidable**.
The subject does not choose the action freely. The focus is on **lack of choice** and often on the **negative feeling** toward the situation.

Unlike **phải₁**, which expresses obligation or duty in a neutral or expected way, **phải₂** emphasizes that the situation is **against the subject’s wish**.
