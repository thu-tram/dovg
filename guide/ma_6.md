## Core Meaning

**mà₆** is used in spoken Vietnamese to **link sentences smoothly in conversation**, often when the speaker continues talking, adds a new point, or reacts to what the listener just said.
It does not add a clear logical meaning by itself; instead, it helps speech sound natural and connected.

With **mà₆**, the speaker is saying: “I’m continuing” or “Let me add something.”
