# bị - v.

## Core Meaning

**bị** is used to show that the subject **undergoes or receives something unfavorable**, unpleasant, or against their will.
The event usually happens **to** the subject, not **because of** the subject’s intention.

In many cases, the subject is affected by an action done by another person, thing, or situation. The focus is not on who does the action, but on **the negative effect on the subject**.

## Situations / Uses

### S1: The subject undergoes a negative action done by someone else

[1a] – Cảnh sát phạt Nam.
The police fined Nam.

[1b] – Nam **bị** cảnh sát phạt.
Nam was fined by the police.

→ In [1b], Nam is the person who **receives** the punishment.
The sentence focuses on Nam’s bad experience, not on the police.

This is one of the most common uses of **bị**.

### S2: The agent may be omitted if it is not important

[2a] – Ông giám đốc giảm lương của Nam.
The director docked Nam’s salary.

[2b] – Nam **bị** giảm lương.
Nam had his salary docked.

→ The agent (ông giám đốc) is omitted because it is not necessary for understanding the situation.
What matters is that Nam suffers an unfavorable result.

### S3: The action affects something related to the subject

[3a] – Bạn cùng lớp đọc thư của Nam.
Nam’s classmates read his letter.

[3b] – Nam **bị** bạn cùng lớp đọc thư.
Nam had his letter read by his classmates.

→ The object of the verb đọc (thư) belongs to Nam.
Nam is negatively affected even though he is not the direct object of the verb.



### S4: An unwanted result caused by circumstances or people in general

[4] – Tôi **bị** người ta mua sách trước mất rồi.
I lost the chance to buy the book because someone else bought it first.

→ The agent is vague (người ta).
The sentence expresses frustration or bad luck.

More examples:

– Tôi **bị** con khóc suốt đêm nên không ngủ được.
I couldn’t sleep because the baby cried all night.

– Tôi đi trễ nên **bị** người khác chiếm chỗ.
I was late, so my seat was taken by someone else.

### S5: Negative states or conditions

[5] – Nam **bị** sốt.
Nam has a fever.

[6] – Cô ấy **bị** đau đầu.
She has a headache.

→ In these cases, **bị** expresses an unpleasant condition.
Very often, **bị** can be omitted without changing the main meaning:

– Nam (bị) sốt.
– Cô ấy (bị) đau đầu.

However, keeping **bị** makes the sentence sound more expressive and subjective.

### S6: Being forced into an unfavorable situation

[7] – Nam **bị** ngồi ghế hạng hai.
Nam had to sit in second class.

→ Nam did not choose this situation.
It happened because of circumstances.



## Contrast / Comparison (Cf)

– **bị**: receiving something unfavorable
– **được**: receiving something favorable

[8a] – Nam **được** khen.
Nam was praised.

[8b] – Nam **bị** phạt.
Nam was punished.

### **bị** vs **phải₂**

– **bị**: focus on negative result
– **phải₂**: focus on obligation or necessity

[9a] – Tôi **phải** nghỉ làm.
I have to take time off.

[9b] – Tôi **bị** nghỉ việc.
I lost my job.
