# Liền (Adv 1)

### Situations

**S1:** Nam received his girlfriend's letter. He was so eager that he read it immediately.
<pre>
Nhận được thư, Nam đọc liền.
(Upon receiving the letter, Nam read it immediately.)
</pre>
**Liền** in this situation expresses the quickness of the action **đọc** (read) just after the moment of receiving the letter.

**S2:** Hà is angry with Nam, so she does not want to see him.
<pre>

In this situation, **liền** also expresses the immediateness of the action **bỏ ra ngoài** (left the room), which is considered the result of the previous action (**thấy Nam bước vào**).

### Definition

**Liền**, as an adverb, is used before or after the verb to indicate the quickness or the immediateness of an action (**S1**); this action may be a result of another action that previously happened (**S2**).

### Related Expressions

**Liền**, when following the verb, can be replaced with **ngay**.
Cf. **ngay1** (p. 269).

### Combinations

- **liền... ngay**:
**Liền**, when placed before the verb, can be combined with **ngay** to emphasize that the action occurred immediately, not later.
<pre>
Nghe anh gọi, tôi liền đến ngay.
(Having received your call, I came immediately.)
</pre>
