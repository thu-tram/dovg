# Ấy (De. Adj.)

### Situations

**S1:** Mr. Thu received a call from someone. Afterward, his wife asked him:

<pre>
Người ấy là bạn cũ của ông có phải không?
(That person is your old friend, isn't it?)
</pre>

**Ấy** here is a demonstrative adjective, used to indicate the person who has just been mentioned or known about.

</pre>

In this situation, **ấy** goes with a noun of time to express past time. It can also go with a noun of place to refer to a place far from the speaker.
