# Đấy (De Adj)

### Situations

**S1:** Mai went to the market to buy a shirt. Lan held up a blue one and asked the price. The salesman answered:
<pre>
[1] Cái áo đấy giá 100.000 đồng.
    (That shirt costs one hundred thousand đồng.)
</pre>
In [1], **đấy** refers to **áo** which is far from the speaker.

**S2:** Mai pointed to a white shirt that was far from her and asked the price. The salesman answered:
<pre>
[2] Cái đấy giá 200.000 đồng.
    (That one costs two hundred thousand đồng.)
</pre>
In **S2**, **đấy** is placed after the pronoun **cái** to refer to the white shirt which is far from both the speaker and the listener.

### Definition

**Đấy**, as a demonstrative, placed after a noun / pronoun, indicates a concrete thing which is far from the speaker (that thing can be near to or far from the listener).
