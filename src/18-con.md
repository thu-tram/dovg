# Con (Cn)

### Situations

**S1:** Hà and Nam were talking about animals. Hà said to Nam:
<pre>
Tôi rất thích chó. Nhà tôi có nuôi ba con chó.
(I like dogs very much. My family has three dogs.)
</pre>
As Hà said so, Nam said:
<pre>
Tôi đang muốn mua mấy con để giữ rẫy cà phê.
(I want to buy some (dogs) that will watch over my coffee farm.)
</pre>
Similar to other unit nouns (**cái**, **chiếc**, **bức**...), **con** is used after cardinal numbers (**một**, **hai**, **ba**, **bốn**...) or quantifiers (**mấy**, **vài**, **cả**...) in order to unitize the mass nouns that refer to animate things mentioned later.

**S2:** Nam and Hà went to the zoo. They were watching the monkeys eating fruit. Hà pointed at a monkey and said to Nam:
<pre>
Con khỉ đang ăn trái chuối ở đằng kia trông dễ thương quá. Mình thích con khỉ đó.
(The monkey over there that is eating bananas looks very cute. I like that monkey.)
</pre>
In **S2**, **con** occurs before the mass noun (which indicates an animal) defined by a distinctive modifier **đang ăn chuối** (eating bananas) or a demonstrative word (**này**, **kia**, **đó**...).

**S3:** Hoa and her mother are sitting in the house. Suddenly, Hoa's mother hears the dog barking. She says to Hoa:
<pre>
Con ra ngoài xem sao mà con chó sủa dữ thế.
(Hoa, go out to see why the dog is barking so much.)
</pre>
In this situation, **con** appears before the noun **chó** without the corresponding conditions mentioned in the situations **S1** and **S2** because, in this context, Hoa knows which dog her mother refers to, that is to say, the noun phrase **con chó** (the dog) is defined by the communicative context.

### Definition

**Con**, as a classifying noun, placed before a noun indicating animals, refers to each individual member of that group of animals.

### Related Expressions

- Classifying noun **con** and other words with the same origin. Cf:
<pre>
[1] Tôi có hai con: một gái, một trai. Năm nay con chị 10 tuổi còn thằng em 6 tuổi.
    (I have two children: one daughter and one son. This year, the older sister is ten years old and her brother is six years old.)
</pre>
In the example above, the first **con** is understood as "child" in relation to his / her parents, whereas the second **con** is a noun which refers to the female gender irrespective of the attitude of the speaker. (Similarly, **thằng** refers to the male gender irrespective of the attitude of the speaker.)
<pre>
[2] Nhà tôi có hai con chó con.
    (My family has two puppies.)
</pre>
In this example, the first **con** is a unit noun, and the second **con** is a common noun; it refers to an animal which was born directly by another animal.

- **con** and **cái**:
**Con** and **cái** are classifying nouns; **con** refers to each individual member of a group of animals. But **cái** refers to each individual member of a group of inanimate things.
Cf. **cái1** (p. 35).

### Combinations

- **cái + con**:
To indicate clearly and to show (at the same time) the idea of not being pleased with the animal mentioned before, the speaker can use the demonstrative **cái** in front of the unit noun **con**. Ex.:
<pre>
[1] Cái con chó nhà anh đã cắn con mèo của tôi.
    (Your dog has bitten my cat.)
</pre>
Cf. **cái2** (p. 43).

- **con + mắt / tim / đường ...**:
The classifying noun **con** also refers to an individual unit of some inanimate things which are seen as "animals" because their activity or forms are similar to those of animals. For example: **con mắt** (an eye), **con tim** (a heart), **con tàu** (a ship), **con đường** (a road, a way), **con sông** (a river), **con thuyền** (a boat), etc. Ex.:
<pre>
[2] Con sông này bắt nguồn từ đâu vậy?
    (Where does this river originate?)
[3] Tôi bị đau mắt. Con mắt phải của tôi sưng húp lên.
    (I have sore eyes. My right eye is swollen.)
</pre>
