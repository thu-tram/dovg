# Mà (Conj 2)

### Situations

**S1:** Lan's father suggests going to Ngọc Sương restaurant, but Lan suggests another one:
<pre>
Sao mình không đi nhà hàng Cánh Buồm đi? Ở đó ngon mà rẻ lắm.
(Why don't we go to Cánh Buồm? It's good and it's very cheap.)
</pre>
Here, **rẻ** adds to the quality of the restaurant being **ngon** (good).

**S2:** After eating at Cánh Buồm, the mother complained:
<pre>
Nhà hàng này ngon mà mắc quá!
(The food in this restaurant is delicious; however, it is too expensive!)
</pre>
Typically, if something is good, it is expensive. Unlike **mà1**, this **mà** does not express a reality contrary to logic; it indicates an additional quality. Therefore, we can say both **ngon mà rẻ** and **ngon mà mắc**.

### Definition

**Mà**, as a conjunction, is used to indicate an additional quality or an addition to what has been suggested or supposed.

### Related Expressions

- **mà** and **nhưng**:
In **S1**, we cannot say **ngon nhưng rẻ** because **rẻ** expresses an additional quality, not a contrast. In **S2**, **mà** (additional) can be replaced with **nhưng** (contrastive). In spoken Vietnamese, **mà** in **S2** is usually replaced with **nhưng mà**.

- **mà** and **lại** / **mà lại**:
In **S1**, **mà** can be replaced with **lại / mà lại**. It does not express a reality contrary to logic but carries the meaning of an additional quality. **Lại** is not used to replace **mà** in **S2**.
Cf. **lại2** (p. 183).
