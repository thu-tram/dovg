### Situations

**S1:** Little Chi went to the zoo with her mother. She continuously asked her mother:
<pre>
Mẹ ơi! Con kia là con gì?

</pre>
In this situation, **kia** is a demonstrative that refers to people / things that are far from the speaker and the listener but can still be seen.

**S2:** The couple said good-bye to each other. The girl said:
<pre>
Em hy vọng một ngày kia anh sẽ hiểu em!

</pre>
In this situation, **kia** indicates a point of time in the future (compared to the time of speaking) which is indefinite, but considered as something that can be imagined.
