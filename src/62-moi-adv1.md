# Mới (Adv 1)

### Situations

**S1:** John arrived in Vietnam yesterday. Nam asked him when he came. John replied:
<pre>
Tôi mới đến Việt Nam hôm qua.
(I just came to Vietnam yesterday.)
</pre>
John perceives that he came to Vietnam just a short time ago.

**S2:** John saw a big hospital in Thủ Đức that wasn't there two years ago. He asked Nam:
<pre>
- Bệnh viện mới xây à?
  (Was the hospital just built?)
- Vâng, mới xây năm ngoái.
  (Yes, it was just built last year.)
</pre>
Both perceive that the hospital was built a short time ago with reference to the moment of speaking (even though it was built a year ago).

### Definition

**Mới**, as an adverb, is used to express an action or a point of time, prior to the moment of speaking or to another moment in the past, which, according to the speaker, occurred a short time ago.

### Related Expressions

In many cases, we can use **vừa**, **vừa mới** instead of **mới** to express an action that occurred in the recent past. **Vừa** is used for an action that happened very recently or just before speaking, while **mới** can be used for an action that occurred quite a long time ago but is perceived by the speaker as having happened recently.
Cf. **vừa1** (p. 413).
