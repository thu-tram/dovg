# Từng (Adv)

### Situations

**S1:** Tân is rich but thrifty. He says:
<pre>
Tôi từng nghèo khổ nên tôi biết giá trị của đồng tiền.
(I used to be poor, so I know the value of money.)
</pre>
Tân speaks about what he has experienced.

**S2:** Nam speaks Russian well, but has never lived in Russia.
<pre>
Tôi chưa từng đi Nga.
(I've never been to Russia.)
</pre>
Nam uses **chưa từng** to deny having had that experience.

### Definition

**Từng**, as an adverb placed before a verb or adjective, is used to express an action or state that someone experienced at least once or more in the past.

### Related Expressions

- **chưa từng**, **chưa bao giờ**, **chưa... lần nào**:
All three indicate that an event has not happened from the past up to the present. However, only **chưa từng** explicitly emphasizes not having had the *experience*.
<pre>
[1a] Tôi chưa từng gặp ông ấy.
[1b] Tôi chưa bao giờ gặp ông ấy.
[1c] Tôi chưa gặp ông ấy lần nào.
</pre>

### Combinations

- **đã từng + V**, **chưa từng + V** are commonly used as phrases. **Từng** is rarely used alone.
- **không từng**, **chẳng từng** are not used.

### NOTES

- In responses to questions (ending in **chưa?**, **có... không?**, etc.), **đã từng** is used for the affirmative and is often followed by proof or an example.
<pre>
[1] Anh biết ông Nam chứ? - Tôi đã từng ăn nhậu với ông ấy.
    (You know Mr. Nam, don't you? - I've been out drinking with him before.)
[2] Ông ta đã từng xin tôi giúp đỡ.
    (He has asked me for help in the past.)
</pre>
