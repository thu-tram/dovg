# Vừa (Adv)

### Situations

**S:** At 8:00, Hà arrived at Nam's house. Nam had left at 7:50. Nam's mother says:
<pre>
Nam vừa đi ra ngoài.
(Nam has just gone out.)
</pre>
**Vừa** is used because the 10-minute interval is considered very short.

### Definition

**Vừa**, as an adverb, is used to express an action or state that occurred right before a set point of time.

### Related Expressions

- **vừa** and **mới**:
Cf. **mới1** (p. 257).

### Combinations

- **vừa mới**: Emphasizes that an action occurred very recently.
<pre>
[1] Tôi vừa mới đến. (I've just arrived.)
</pre>

- **vừa... đã...**: Two actions happening in rapid succession without a pause.
<pre>
[2] Anh mệt quá nên vừa nằm xuống đã ngủ.
    (He was so tired that as soon as he lay down, he fell asleep.)
</pre>

- **vừa... vừa...**: Two events, qualities, or actions happening simultaneously.
<pre>
[3] Anh ta thường vừa ăn cơm tối vừa xem TV.
    (He usually watches TV while eating dinner.)
[4] Cô ấy vừa thông minh vừa chăm chỉ.
    (She is both intelligent and diligent.)
</pre>

- **vừa... vừa...** can sometimes be replaced by:
<pre>
- không những... mà còn...
- đã... còn...
- đã... lại...
</pre>
These emphasize a complementary relationship where the second item adds value to the first. Both items must be positive or both negative. However, **không những... mà còn...** does not always imply simultaneity in the way **vừa... vừa...** does.
