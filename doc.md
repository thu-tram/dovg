- 1 want lo buy some (dogs) thai will watch over my coffee farm Similar to other classifying nouns (cái, chiếc, bức\...), con is used after cardinal numbers (một, hai, ba. bon\....) or quantifiers ( mấy. vài, cd,\...) in order to unitize the mass nouns that refer to animate things mentioned later.

homesick, he says:

Dã here indicates the event which is completed before the point of by this time next week..

Dã, as an adverh, is used to indicate what happened before a certain point of lime (normally, this point of lime, if not marked by a specific time, will be considered as the present time.)

RELATED EXPRESSIONS

♦ đã and rồi

Dã. rồi both indicate an event, a stale or an action that is completed before a certain point of time. They can be used interchangeably or as a combination đã \... rồi. However, their meaning is different:

• Rồi is used to emphasize (he completion of an event that seems farther away in the past.

Cf:

(la\] -Ăn cơm chưa? -Ản rồi. Have you eaten? - I have. (The action (bl (cat) came to an end).

\[lb\] - Ản cơm chưa ? - Dã ủn. Did you cal? - 1 did I the action dll tent) IS done)

- • Rồi usually goes with certain adjectives (đẹp. ốm. giò. ngon\...) to indicate a quality or stale.

Ci:

- \[2a\] - Miu như the nà V ngon roi. Lil. Cooking like this IS lasiy aheady

- \[2bJ - \* Nâu như thê này đã ngon.

<!-- -->

- • Dã can also be combined with these adjectives (dẹp. ốm. già. ngon\...), but this W\'ay of speaking expresses a different meaning from the construction adjective + rồi:

Cf:

- \[3a\] - Nấu như thế nãy. dôi với tôi đã là ngon lắm! Cooking like this, according to me is very good! (lit.) (no additions / requirements.)

- \[3bI - Nâu như thế này. đối với tôi là ngon lắm rồi! Cooking like this, according to me IS Very good! ( the requirements are satisfied)

roti - p. 327

♦ dã.dang

Because dã expresses the reality of the event, in many cases it can be replaced with dang.

Cf:

\[4a\] ỉỉây giờ đang là múa mưa. Il IS now (he rainy season

14b\] - Bây gi(f dã là múa mưa. Il IS ahead) the rainy season

In \[4a\], the rainy season started before the lime of speaking, and ii is already a reality.

In \|4b\], ihe rainy season IS in process, and at this point in time, it has not ended yet.

\* dang - p. 119

NOTES.

- • In Vietnamese language, đã is not used to express past lime (tense), therefore it is necessary to choose carefully when to use (or not to use) đã when translating from Vietnamese to English or vice versa.

Cf:

\[5a\] -Anh khỏe không? ---Cảm ơn. tôi khỏe. How arc you?-Thanks, Pin fine

Ị5bI -Anh dã khỏe chưa? - Cảm ơn. tôi đã khởe.

Are you feeling belter? - Thanks. 1 feel belter. (Before I was not well, but now I am no longer ill)

16a\] - Ông đy là giám đốc. He IS a director.

\[6b\] - Ong ây dã là giám dốc. He became (and now IS) a director.

- • To determine time, we often use words indicating time like hâm qua (yesterday), tuần trước (last week) \... (especially when the context is not clear) without using dã. Cf:

\[7a\] - Tối hôm qua. tôi dá gọi cho cô ấy. 1 did call her yesterday evening

\[7b\] - Tôi hòm qua tôi gọi cho cô ây. - 1 called her last evening. \[7c\] - (Anh gọi cho cô ây chưa?) - Tôi dã gọi, nhưng không có ai trà lời. (Did you call her yet?) - Yes, 1 did. but nobody answered.

Dã is used to indicate the reality / status quo, while the words indicating time cannot be substituted for đã. In many situations, đã cannot be exchanged for time words (for example, when đã is followed by a verb indicating a slate or quality). Cf:

\[8a\] - Tôi dã yêu anh ây. I have been / am in love with him.

\[8b\] - 7\'háng trước tỏi yêu anh ây. I loved him last month.

\[9a\] --- fíò tôi dã yếu lắm. My father has been / IS very weak.

S4. Tail put a jar of perfume in his pocket. His wife saw it and asked:

This is similar to interrogative questions which have the Wh-qucstion at the beginning of the sentence such as: Ai đây? (Who's there?). Hao nhiêu làu? (How long?). Con gi kia? (What's that animal?)

Dây. as a demonstrative pronoun, is used to show that a person / thing / place (which the speaker mentioned) is near both the speaker and the listener.
