<p><strong>S1:</strong> When seeing his mother back home from the market, the child exclaims:</p>
<pre>
A! Mẹ đã về!
(Oh! Mom is back!)
</pre>
<p>In this situation, the child expresses his joy.</p>
<p><strong>S2:</strong> Lan's husband usually comes home late on Saturday. But today he arrives home early. Lan says:</p>
<pre>
A, hôm nay anh về sớm quá!
(Oh, you are home early today!)
</pre>
<p>In this situation, Lan expresses her surprise.</p>
<p><strong>S3:</strong> Nam made an appointment with Bình to return his money. At the coffee shop, they talked a lot. He didn't remember to return the money until he was about to leave. He said:</p>
<pre>
A! Tôi quên, tôi chưa trả tiền cho anh.
(Oh! I forgot. I didn't return your money yet.)
</pre>
<p>In this situation, <strong>a</strong> is used to indicate that the speaker remembers something.</p>
<h3 id="definition"><a class="header" href="#definition">Definition</a></h3>
<p><strong>A</strong>, as an exclamatory word, is used at the beginning of the sentence to show joy, surprise, or to indicate that the speaker remembers something.</p>
<h3 id="related-expressions"><a class="header" href="#related-expressions">Related Expressions</a></h3>
<p><strong>A!</strong> is an exclamatory sentence in <strong>S1</strong> and <strong>S3</strong>, and <strong>a</strong> used at the beginning of the sentence is an exclamatory word in <strong>S2</strong>.</p>
<p>Both <strong>a</strong> and <strong>à</strong>, used interchangeably, express that the speaker is surprised or just figures out something. However, <strong>a</strong> is not used to express joy.</p>
<pre>
[1] — À, mẹ về!
(Yeah! Mom is back!)
</pre>
<p>We use <strong>thảo nào</strong> / <strong>hèn chi</strong> / <strong>hèn gì</strong> to express surprise when we suddenly remember or realize something. But <strong>thảo nào</strong> is used to express a conclusion or new discovery about something. Cf:</p>
<p>Hoa tells Lan that Mrs. Ba has just won the lottery. Lan says:</p>
<pre>
[2] Thảo nào dạo này trông bà ấy trẻ ra.
(That is why she looks younger these days.)
</pre>
<p>Lan suddenly remembers that Mrs. Ba still owes her money. Lan asks:</p>
<pre>
[3] À, chị có nghe bà ấy nói khi nào bà ấy trả tiền cho tôi không?
(Oh, did you hear her say when she will return my money?)
</pre>
<h3 id="combinations"><a class="header" href="#combinations">Combinations</a></h3>
<p><strong>À, ra vậy!</strong> (Cf. <strong>thảo nào</strong>), is used to express that we realize or understand something after hearing some news or an explanation. This expression is like a conclusion.</p>
<p>John speaks Vietnamese very well. Hà tells Nam that John's mother is Vietnamese. Nam says:</p>
<pre>
[1] — À, ra vậy!
(Oh, now I understand!)
</pre>
<p><strong>À</strong> is also used in combination with <strong>thảo nào</strong> / <strong>hèn chi</strong> / <strong>hèn gì</strong> to express surprise and sudden understanding.</p>
<pre>
[2] — À, thảo nào!
(Oh, that is why!)
</pre><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="À-par"><a class="header" href="#À-par">À (Par.)</a></h1>
<h3 id="situations-1"><a class="header" href="#situations-1">Situations</a></h3>
<p><strong>S1:</strong> Nam and Hà have been swimming for an hour. Hà looks tired. Nam says:</p>
<pre>
Anh mệt rồi à?
(You are tired, aren't you?)
</pre>
<p>In this situation, Nam wants to verify his observation (that Hà is tired), so he uses <strong>à</strong> at the end of the question.</p>
<p><strong>S2:</strong> Every morning, when seeing Tom get on his bike to go to work, the hostess asks:</p>
<pre>
Anh đi làm à?
(You are going to work, right?)
</pre>
<p>In this situation, the hostess does not wait for an answer from Tom. She just wants to express interest in Tom.</p>
<h3 id="definition-1"><a class="header" href="#definition-1">Definition</a></h3>
<p><strong>À</strong>, as a particle, placed at the end of a question, is used to ask for more information about something that the speaker is observing (based on certain evidence). This particle is also often used in spoken language to express concern for or interest in the listener.</p>
<h3 id="related-expressions-1"><a class="header" href="#related-expressions-1">Related Expressions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>À</strong> and <strong>hả</strong> can be used interchangeably. However, <strong>hả</strong> is particularly used to ask for more information about something that is unclear to the speaker.</li>
<li><strong>À</strong>, <strong>nhỉ</strong>, <strong>nhé</strong>, <strong>chứ</strong>, <strong>ư</strong>, etc., belong to the final sentence particle group, but they connote different meanings.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="situations-2"><a class="header" href="#situations-2">Situations</a></h3>
<p><strong>S1:</strong> Lan, pointing at a young lady standing at the door, asked Nam: "Who is that?", Nam answered:</p>
<pre>
Ấy là cô thư ký mới.
(That is the new secretary.)
</pre>
<p><strong>Ấy</strong> here is a pronoun indicating a person at a distance from both speaker and listener.</p>
<p><strong>S2:</strong> Hung's mother punished him because he was lazy in schoolwork. After punishment, she said:</p>
<pre>
Ấy là mẹ muốn con chăm chỉ hơn.
(That is because I want you to be more studious.)
</pre>
<p>The pronoun <strong>ấy</strong> refers to the mother's punishment.</p>
<h3 id="definition-2"><a class="header" href="#definition-2">Definition</a></h3>
<p><strong>Ấy</strong>, as a demonstrative pronoun, is used to refer to a person or thing far from both speaker and listener, or to refer to something which has just been mentioned.</p>
<p>As a subject, the pronoun <strong>ấy</strong> occurs only at the beginning of the sentence and goes only with the copula <strong>là</strong>. Note that <strong>ấy</strong> cannot be used as an object.</p>
<h3 id="related-expressions-2"><a class="header" href="#related-expressions-2">Related Expressions</a></h3>
<p>In fact, <strong>ấy</strong> is not often used as a subject, but <strong>đó</strong> / <strong>đấy</strong> are used instead to indicate a person or thing which is far from the speaker and the listener, or which has just been mentioned.</p>
<pre>
[1] — Ấy / Đó / Đấy là tôi muốn giúp anh.
(It is that I want to help you.)
</pre>
<p><strong>Đó</strong> / <strong>đấy</strong> can occur as a complement of place, but <strong>ấy</strong> cannot.</p>
<pre>
[2] — Tôi đã sống ở đấy / đó / *ấy 10 năm.
(I had been living there for 10 years.)
</pre>
<p>Note: <strong>Đó</strong> is often used in the Southern dialect.</p>
<p>The pronouns <strong>đây</strong>, <strong>này</strong> refer to a person or thing close to both the speaker and the listener. Cf:</p>
<pre>
[3a] — Ấy là em gái tôi.
(That is my younger sister.)

[3b] — Đây là em gái tôi.
(This is my younger sister.)

[3c] — Này là chị ruột, này là em dâu.
(This is my blood elder sister, and this is my sister-in-law.)
</pre>
<p>Note: The pronoun <strong>này</strong> is rarely used as a subject of the sentence.</p>

<h3 id="situations-3"><a class="header" href="#situations-3">Situations</a></h3>
<p><strong>S1:</strong> Mr. Thu received a call from someone. Afterward, his wife asked him:</p>
<pre>
Người ấy là bạn cũ của ông có phải không?
(That person is your old friend, isn't it?)
</pre>
<p><strong>Ấy</strong> here is a demonstrative adjective, used to indicate the person who has just been mentioned or known about.</p>
<p><strong>S2:</strong> Mr. Lam is already old. He always thinks that the people of his time were all good, and the people of today are all bad. He says:</p>
<pre>
Cái thời ấy, ai cũng tốt cả!
(In those days, everybody was good!)
</pre>
<p>In this situation, <strong>ấy</strong> goes with a noun of time to express past time. It can also go with a noun of place to refer to a place far from the speaker.</p>
<h3 id="definition-3"><a class="header" href="#definition-3">Definition</a></h3>
<p><strong>Ấy</strong>, as a demonstrative adjective, placed after a noun (concrete noun, abstract noun, noun indicating time, noun indicating place), is used to indicate a person, thing, or event which has just been mentioned or known about.</p>
<h3 id="related-expressions-3"><a class="header" href="#related-expressions-3">Related Expressions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ấy</strong> belongs to the demonstrative adjective group of <strong>này</strong>, <strong>đấy</strong>, <strong>đó</strong>, and <strong>kia</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Ấy</strong> (as a demonstrative adjective) can often be replaced with <strong>đó</strong>, especially in the Southern dialect.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="combinations-1"><a class="header" href="#combinations-1">Combinations</a></h3>
<p>In the Vietnamese language, many nouns indicating kinship (family relationships) may go with <strong>ấy</strong> to form personal pronouns of the third person, such as: <strong>ông ấy</strong>, <strong>bà ấy</strong>, <strong>anh ấy</strong>, <strong>chị ấy</strong>, etc.</p>
<pre>
Vợ anh tên gì? Chị ấy làm nghề gì?
(What is your wife's name? What is her job?)

<h3 id="situations-4"><a class="header" href="#situations-4">Situations</a></h3>
<p><strong>S1:</strong> Nam was driving too fast. He was stopped and fined by the police.
Cf:</p>
<pre>
[1a] Cảnh sát phạt Nam.
(The police fined Nam)
[1b] Nam bị cảnh sát phạt.
(Nam was fined by the police.)
</pre>
<p>In [1b], Nam is the object that undergoes the punishment; in [1a], Nam is the subject receiving punishment from the police.</p>
<p><strong>S2:</strong> Nam went to work late. The director decided to dock his salary.
Cf:</p>
<pre>
[2a] Ông giám đốc giảm lương của Nam.
(The director docked Nam's salary.)
[2b] Nam bị (ông giám đốc) giảm lương.
(Nam's salary was docked (by the director).)
</pre>
<p>In [2b] <strong>lương</strong> (salary) is the object of the action <strong>giảm</strong> (to dock), and Nam is the person that undergoes this action. In many cases, the person who does the action may go unmentioned if it is not necessary to complete the meaning (See [1b], [2b]).</p>
<p><strong>S3:</strong> Nam has just received his girlfriend's letter. His classmates read it before he did.
Cf:</p>
<pre>
[3a] Bạn cùng lớp đọc thư của Nam.
(Nam's classmates read his letter.)
[3b] Nam bị bạn cùng lớp đọc thư.
(Nam's letter was read by his classmates.)
</pre>
<p><strong>S4:</strong> Only one Vietnamese language dictionary is still in the bookshop. Nam wanted to buy it, but a man took it before he did. He said:</p>
<pre>
[4] Tôi bị người ta mua sách trước mất rồi.
(The book I wanted to buy had been bought by someone else.)
</pre>
<p>In the situations <strong>S3</strong> and <strong>S4</strong>, the actions <strong>đọc</strong> (to read) and <strong>mua</strong> (to buy) cause unfavorable things for Nam. <strong>Thư</strong> (letter) is his letter, and <strong>sách</strong> (book) is a thing in which he is interested. Complementary example:</p>
<pre>
Tôi bị con khóc suốt đêm nên không ngủ được.
(I could not sleep because my baby cried all night long.)

Tôi đi trễ nên bị người khác chiếm chỗ.
(I was late so my place was occupied by another person.)
</pre>
<p><strong>S5:</strong> Nam is running a 40° C temperature.</p>
<pre>
[5] Nam bị sốt.
(Nam has a fever.)
</pre>
<p><strong>S6:</strong> Nam was late to buy a first-class ticket. So he had to get a second-class one.</p>
<pre>
[6] Nam bị ngồi ghế hạng hai.
(Nam had to go second class.)
</pre>
<p>In the situations <strong>S5</strong> and <strong>S6</strong>, <strong>bị</strong> is used to express a negative or unfavorable thing that the subject undergoes. In many cases (such as <strong>bị bệnh</strong>, <strong>bị đau</strong>, <strong>bị chết</strong>...), <strong>bị</strong> can be omitted without changing the main meaning of the sentence.</p>
<h3 id="definition-4"><a class="header" href="#definition-4">Definition</a></h3>
<p><strong>Bị</strong>, as a verb, is used to express that the subject undergoes something which is done/caused by the object (as an agent), and which is unfavourable to the subject.</p>
<h3 id="related-expressions-4"><a class="header" href="#related-expressions-4">Related Expressions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bị</strong> belongs to the verb group of <strong>được</strong>, <strong>bị</strong>, <strong>phải</strong> that expresses receiving or undergoing something favorable or unfavorable.</li>
<li>Cf: <strong>được1</strong> (p. 139), <strong>phải2</strong> (p. 309), <strong>mất</strong> (p. 243).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="combinations-2"><a class="header" href="#combinations-2">Combinations</a></h3>

<p>In the Vietnamese language, a sentence with the verb <strong>bị</strong> must not always be regarded as a passive sentence. Rather, it is a subject-predicate structure sentence that indicates that the subject undergoes something by someone / something else.</p>
<ul>
<li>For some action verbs the agent and the receiver are reversed when the verb is accompanied with <strong>bị</strong>: <strong>bị giết</strong> / <strong>giết</strong>, <strong>bị đánh</strong> / <strong>đánh</strong>, <strong>bị phạt</strong> / <strong>phạt</strong>... In this case the sentence structure is changed, with the agent always placed after <strong>bị</strong> and before the verb.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
[3] Anh ấy giết con gấu.
(He killed a bear.)
[4] Anh ấy bị con gấu giết.
(He was killed by a bear.)
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Some words always preceded by <strong>bị</strong>, form idiomatic groups, such as: <strong>bị đạn</strong>, <strong>bị tên</strong>, <strong>bị thương</strong> (be wounded)....</li>

(Tomorrow, the whole school will go to Vũng Tàu.)

<p>In this situation, <strong>trường</strong> is considered as a unit (though it is a group of many parts, like teachers, schoolchildren, office employees). So it can go with the adjective <strong>cả</strong>.</p>

Anh ấy có ba cái nhà, một cái ở Đà Lạt, một cái ở Vũng Tàu và một cái ở Nha Trang.
(He has got three houses, one in Đà Lạt, one in Vũng Tàu and one in Nha Trang.)
</pre>
<p>In this situation, <strong>cái</strong>, classifying noun, used after a number, unitizes the mass noun referring to things. If the prior context defines the mass noun, then in subsequent uses the mass noun following <strong>cái</strong> can be omitted.</p>
<p><strong>S2:</strong> Hearing that Tâm wants to buy a camera, Hải says:</p>
<pre>
Tôi thấy cửa hàng T. đang bán mấy cái máy ảnh rất hiện đại.
(I saw a few modern cameras in the T. shop.)
</pre>
<p><strong>Cái</strong> usually appears after the quantifiers like <strong>mấy</strong>, <strong>vài</strong>, <strong>một số</strong>, <strong>nửa</strong>, etc., or after the articles like <strong>một</strong>, <strong>những</strong>, <strong>các</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>S3:</strong> In the clothes shop, Lan pointed at a shirt and said to the owner:</p>
<pre>
[1] Cho em xem cái áo kia đi, chị.
(Show me that shirt, please.)
[2] Cái nào? Cái này cô mặc hợp lắm đấy.
(Which one? This one goes well with you.)
</pre>
<p>In [1] and [2], the classifying noun <strong>cái</strong> is used to unitize the noun phrases defined by the demonstratives like <strong>này</strong>, <strong>kia</strong>, or the interrogative <strong>nào</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>S4:</strong> Lan's mother just came to the door when it started pouring. She called Lan:</p>
<pre>
[4] Lan ơi! Lấy cho mẹ cái áo mưa.
(Lan! Give me the raincoat.)
</pre>
<p>In this situation, it is not necessary for <strong>cái</strong> to be used with a number, quantifier or demonstrative like in <strong>S1</strong>, <strong>S2</strong> and <strong>S3</strong>. The noun phrase <strong>cái áo mưa</strong> is understood when the listener (Lan) knows which one it is. In other words, the noun phrase <strong>cái áo mưa</strong> is singular and defined in the specific context.</p>
<p><strong>S5:</strong> Hoa and Lan are talking about a film which has just been shown on TV:</p>
<pre>
[5] Cái hay của đạo diễn là để người xem tự tưởng tượng ra đoạn kết của bộ phim.
(The creative talent of the director was that he gave the viewers the chance to imagine the end of his film.)
</pre>
<p><strong>Cái</strong> is used in this situation to nominalize a quality expressed by an adjective.</p>
<p><strong>S6:</strong> Hải and Hùng are talking about their lives. Hải complains:</p>
<pre>
[6] Tôi còn rất vất vả. Phải lo cái ăn, cái mặc cho cả gia đình.
(I must still work very hard. I have to take care of food and clothes for my family.)
</pre>
<p>In this situation, <strong>cái</strong> is used to nominalize the verb, or in other words, to transform an action into a thing. Here, it is understood that <strong>cái ăn</strong>, <strong>cái mặc</strong>, etc. is something to eat or something to put on (food, clothing, etc.).</p>
<h3 id="definition-8"><a class="header" href="#definition-8">Definition</a></h3>
<p><strong>Cái</strong>, as a unit noun, is used before a mass noun to unitize the thing expressed by the mass noun which follows it. <strong>Cái</strong> is also used to nominalize a verb or an adjective.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cái</strong> and <strong>chiếc</strong>, <strong>cây</strong>, <strong>bức</strong>, <strong>tờ</strong>, <strong>căn</strong>, etc.:
In many cases, <strong>cái</strong> can be used in place of the other unit nouns such as <strong>chiếc</strong>, <strong>cây</strong>, <strong>bức</strong>, etc. especially in spoken Vietnamese. Ex.:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
[1] Anh tôi cho tôi cây / cái bút này.
(My older brother gave me this pen.)
[2] Bức / cái bản đồ này chi tiết hơn bức / cái bản đồ kia.
(This map is more detailed than that map.)
[3] Chiếc / cái xe này tôi mua năm ngoái.
(I bought this motorbike last year.)
</pre>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <strong>Cái</strong> is only used in place of unit nouns referring to things (inanimate), but it is not used in place of <strong>con</strong>, a unit noun referring to animals (except for very small animals like <strong>cái sâu</strong> (a worm), <strong>cái kiến</strong> (an ant), etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>cái</strong> cannot be used in place of classifying nouns referring to substances like <strong>viên gạch</strong> (a brick), <strong>cục đá</strong> (a stone), <strong>tờ giấy</strong> (a sheet of paper), <strong>giọt nước</strong> (a drop of water), <strong>tấm vải</strong> (a piece of cloth), etc. Cf:</p>
<pre>
[4a] Cục / *cái xà phòng này giá 6.000 đồng.
(This bar of soap costs six thousand dong.)
[4b] Anh chở đến nhà tôi 2.000 viên / *cái gạch.

<p>(We cannot say ... <em>cái áo đầm</em>)</p>
<pre>
[2] Tôi mua cái áo đầm ấy ở tiệm TiTi.
(I bought that robe at the TiTi shop.)
</pre>
<p>(We cannot say ... <em>áo đầm ấy</em>)
The noun phrase <strong>áo đầm</strong> in [1] is the generic noun phrase that serves to indicate that this is not a shirt or <strong>áo dài</strong>, etc. That is why it does not require the presence of the classifying noun <strong>cái</strong>, while the phrase <strong>áo đầm ấy</strong> in [2] is a restrictive noun phrase that indicates a defined thing, therefore, it does require the classifying noun <strong>cái</strong> to precede it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>cái thì... cái thì...</strong>
This construction is used to express a relationship of contrast between things of the same category. Ex.:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
[3] Sáng nay tôi đã đi tìm mua vài cái quần jean, nhưng chẳng mua được cái nào cả. Cái thì quá rộng, cái thì quá hẹp.

<p>In both of the above situations, <strong>cái</strong> is used freely in front of noun phrases which have a restrictive / determinative attribute that aim to point out, bring up a thing which distinguishes it from the rest / remaining ones.</p>

</pre>
<p>As Hà said so, Nam said:</p>
<pre>
Tôi đang muốn mua mấy con để giữ rẫy cà phê.
(I want to buy some (dogs) that will watch over my coffee farm.)
</pre>
<p>Similar to other unit nouns (<strong>cái</strong>, <strong>chiếc</strong>, <strong>bức</strong>...), <strong>con</strong> is used after cardinal numbers (<strong>một</strong>, <strong>hai</strong>, <strong>ba</strong>, <strong>bốn</strong>...) or quantifiers (<strong>mấy</strong>, <strong>vài</strong>, <strong>cả</strong>...) in order to unitize the mass nouns that refer to animate things mentioned later.</p>
<p><strong>S2:</strong> Nam and Hà went to the zoo. They were watching the monkeys eating fruit. Hà pointed at a monkey and said to Nam:</p>
<pre>
Con khỉ đang ăn trái chuối ở đằng kia trông dễ thương quá. Mình thích con khỉ đó.
(The monkey over there that is eating bananas looks very cute. I like that monkey.)
</pre>
<p>In <strong>S2</strong>, <strong>con</strong> occurs before the mass noun (which indicates an animal) defined by a distinctive modifier <strong>đang ăn chuối</strong> (eating bananas) or a demonstrative word (<strong>này</strong>, <strong>kia</strong>, <strong>đó</strong>...).</p>
<p><strong>S3:</strong> Hoa and her mother are sitting in the house. Suddenly, Hoa's mother hears the dog barking. She says to Hoa:</p>
<pre>
Con ra ngoài xem sao mà con chó sủa dữ thế.
(Hoa, go out to see why the dog is barking so much.)
</pre>
<p>In this situation, <strong>con</strong> appears before the noun <strong>chó</strong> without the corresponding conditions mentioned in the situations <strong>S1</strong> and <strong>S2</strong> because, in this context, Hoa knows which dog her mother refers to, that is to say, the noun phrase <strong>con chó</strong> (the dog) is defined by the communicative context.</p>
<h3 id="definition-17"><a class="header" href="#definition-17">Definition</a></h3>
<p><strong>Con</strong>, as a classifying noun, placed before a noun indicating animals, refers to each individual member of that group of animals.</p>

</pre>
<p>In the example above, the first <strong>con</strong> is understood as "child" in relation to his / her parents, whereas the second <strong>con</strong> is a noun which refers to the female gender irrespective of the attitude of the speaker.

<p>All three of these sentences express continuation of the state "awake" (<strong>thức</strong>), but they imply different meanings:</p>

<li>In the Vietnamese language, <strong>đã</strong> is not used to express past time (tense). Therefore, it is necessary to choose carefully when to use (or not to use) <strong>đã</strong> when translating from Vietnamese to English or vice-versa.
Cf:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
[5a] Anh khỏe không? - Cảm ơn, tôi khỏe.
     (How are you? - Thanks, I'm fine.)
[5b] Anh đã khỏe chưa? - Cảm ơn, tôi đã khỏe.
     (Are you feeling better? - Thanks, I feel better.)
</pre>
<p>(Before I was not well, but now I am no longer ill.)</p>
<pre>
[6a] Ông ấy là giám đốc.
     (He is a director.)
[6b] Ông ấy đã là giám đốc.
     (He became (and now is) a director.)
</pre>
<ul>
<li>To determine time, we often use words indicating time like <strong>hôm qua</strong> (yesterday), <strong>tuần trước</strong> (last week)... (especially when the context is not clear) without using <strong>đã</strong>. Cf:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
[7a] Tối hôm qua, tôi đã gọi cho cô ấy.
     (I did call her yesterday evening.)
[7b] Tối hôm qua tôi gọi cho cô ấy.
     (I called her yesterday evening.)
[7c] (Anh gọi cho cô ấy chưa?) - Tôi đã gọi, nhưng không có ai trả lời.
     ((Did you call her yet?) - Yes, I did, but nobody answered.)
</pre>
<p><strong>Đã</strong> is used to indicate the reality / status quo, while the words indicating time cannot be substituted for <strong>đã</strong>. In many situations, <strong>đã</strong> cannot be exchanged for time words (for example, when <strong>đã</strong> is followed by a verb indicating a state or quality). Cf:</p>
<pre>
[8a] Tôi đã yêu anh ấy.
     (I have been / am in love with him.)
[8b] Tháng trước tôi yêu anh ấy.
     (I loved him last month.)
[9a] Bố tôi đã yếu lắm.
     (My father has been / is very weak.)
[9b] Năm ngoái bố tôi yếu lắm.
     (Last year, my father was very weak.)

<p><strong>S1:</strong> Nam introduces Mr. Johnson to his classmates:</p>
<pre>
Đây là ông Johnson, người Mỹ.
(This is Mr. Johnson, an American.)
</pre>
<p><strong>Đây</strong>, a demonstrative pronoun, is used to show that the person or thing mentioned is near the speaker and the listener.</p>
<p><strong>S2:</strong> Nam entered a pub. Seeing an empty chair, he asked a person who was sitting nearby:</p>
<pre>
Tôi ngồi đây có được không ạ?

</pre>
<p>In this situation, <strong>đây</strong> is used to indicate a place near both the speaker and the listener.</p>
<p><strong>S3:</strong> Nam bought a ticket to go to Nha Trang. The salesperson handed him the ticket and said:</p>
<pre>
Vé của anh đây!
(Here's your ticket!) (Lit. Your ticket is here!)
</pre>
<p><strong>Đây</strong> in this situation is placed at the end of the sentence and is used to indicate close proximity when the speaker gives / points out something to another person. It can be understood as a syntactic-reversed case. In the sentence "<strong>Đây là vé của anh</strong>", the speaker focuses on the position <strong>đây</strong> (here), not <strong>kia</strong> (there). It can be analyzed as "<strong>vé của anh</strong>" (your ticket) is the topic, and <strong>đây</strong> (here) is the comment / explanation.</p>
<p><strong>S4:</strong> Tài put a jar of perfume in his pocket. His wife saw it and asked:</p>
<pre>
Cái gì đây?
(What's this?)
</pre>
<p>Like in <strong>S3</strong>, we can understand "<strong>Cái gì đây?</strong>" as a syntactic-reversed case of the sentence "<strong>Đây là cái gì?</strong>". This is similar to interrogative questions which have the Wh-question at the beginning of the sentence such as: "<strong>Ai đây?</strong>" (Who's there?), "<strong>Bao nhiêu lâu?</strong>" (How long?), "<strong>Con gì kia?</strong>" (What's that animal?).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>vừa mới</strong>: Emphasizes that an action occurred very recently.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
[1] Tôi vừa mới đến. (I've just arrived.)

<ul>
<li><strong>vừa... đã...</strong>: Two actions happening in rapid succession without a pause.</li>

[2] Anh mệt quá nên vừa nằm xuống đã ngủ.

<ul>
<li><strong>vừa... vừa...</strong> can sometimes be replaced by:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
- không những... mà còn...
- đã... còn...
- đã... lại...
</pre>
<p>These emphasize a complementary relationship where the second item adds value to the first. Both items must be positive or both negative. However, <strong>không những... mà còn...</strong> does not always imply simultaneity in the way <strong>vừa... vừa...</strong> does.</p>
